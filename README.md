## Quick Overview

```sh
npm install -g create-ts-lib

create-ts-lib my-typescript-lib
cd my-typescript-lib/
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your bootstrapped module.
When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

### Get Started Immediately

You **donâ€™t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured so that you can focus on the code, but as a starter kit you still can modify them.

Just create a project, and youâ€™re good to go.

## Getting started

### Installation

Install it once globally:

```sh
npm install -g create-ts-lib
```

### Creating a TypeScript module

To create a new module, run:

```sh
create-ts-lib my-ts-module
cd my-ts-module
```

It will create a directory called `my-ts-module` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-ts-module
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.spec.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vendor.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tests
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ unit
â”‚        â””â”€â”€ spec-bundle.js
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ karma.conf.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tslint.json
â”œâ”€â”€ typings.json
â””â”€â”€ webpack.config.js
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

### `npm start` or `npm run server:prod`

Runs the app in development / production mode using Webpack dev server.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) ðŸŽ‰ to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests using Karma as test runner and Jasmine as testing framework.

### `npm run build` or `npm run build:prod`
Build a development release

After build phase, 3 files are generated into the `dist` folder:
- `app.bundle.js` - contains the core of the application. From the entry point `src/index.ts`
- `vendor.bundle.js` - contains the vendor dependencies. From the entry point `src/vendor.ts` (lodash is added as an example)
- `index.html` - html page referencing these files
